# Plan

* Understand how to train and evaluate with each dataset. The splitting of the
  train and validation sets are done automatically -- what about the splitting
  of the test set, though?
* Figure out what it takes to make it easy to do hyperparameter tuning (and
  watching of progress on a Tensorboard), and do a parameter search for the best
  model for different datasets.
* Do experiments to assess effect of changes in the dataset (grouping of
  companies / definition of clists, which features are used, etc.)
